Architectural components
A robust online grocery system is composed of four main layers that separate user interfaces, business logic, and data storage. 
1. Presentation layer
This is the front end that customers and staff interact with. All interfaces are mobile applications targeting Android deployment via Google Play Store. All the mobile apps use kotlin for app development.
Customer-facing app: A native Android mobile app for browsing products, managing carts, and placing orders.
Admin mobile app: A native Android mobile app for managing products, viewing order histories, and monitoring sales and performance analytics.
Shopper/driver app: A native Android mobile app for staff to receive, accept, and track delivery or pickup orders.
2. Application layer (microservices)
This layer contains the business logic, with each component functioning as an independent microservice. 
User service: Manages user authentication, account details, and profile information.
Product catalog service: Controls the product listings, categories, images, and descriptions.
Shopping cart service: Manages items added to a user's cart. This service needs to be fast and may involve caching for a responsive user experience.
Inventory service: Tracks stock levels and availability in real-time, sending automated low-stock alerts. For large systems, this may integrate with a warehouse management system (WMS).
Order service: Manages the entire order lifecycle, from placement and payment processing to fulfillment and history.
Payment service: Processes secure transactions by integrating with external payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal.
Notification service: Sends communications to users via email and push notifications for events like order confirmation, shipment updates, and delivery status.
Delivery/Logistics service: Assigns delivery staff, manages routes, and provides real-time tracking via an integrated third-party mapping API, such as Google Maps. 
3. Data layer
This layer stores all the information required by the application services using Supabase as the primary backend.
Supabase Database: PostgreSQL database provided by Supabase for managing structured data for users, orders, and products with built-in real-time capabilities.
Supabase Storage: File storage for product images, user avatars, and other media assets.
Supabase Auth: Built-in authentication system for secure user management across all mobile apps.
Supabase Real-time: Live data synchronization for order tracking, inventory updates, and notifications.
Caching: Supabase Edge Functions and built-in caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to improve response times.
4. Infrastructure and security layer
This layer provides the fundamental infrastructure and security measures to run the system. 
Vercel Deployment: Vercel platform for deploying and hosting API endpoints, serverless functions, and static assets with automatic scaling.
Supabase Infrastructure: Managed cloud infrastructure with built-in security, automatic backups, and global edge locations.
Content Delivery Network (CDN): Vercel's global CDN for fast delivery of static assets and Supabase CDN for media files.
Security protocols: Supabase Row Level Security (RLS), SSL encryption, OAuth authentication, and mobile app security best practices for Google Play Store compliance.
Google Play Store Requirements: Compliance with Google Play policies, app signing, and security standards for Android app distribution.
Core functionalities
The design of an online grocery system must incorporate several core features to provide a seamless user experience. 
For the customer
User authentication: Allow customers to sign up and log in securely.
Product browsing and search: Enable searching for products by name, category, or brand with advanced filtering options.
Personalization: Provide product recommendations based on a user's purchase history and preferences.
Shopping cart management: Add, delete, and modify items in a persistent cart.
Flexible checkout: Offer multiple payment options, including digital wallets, and allow for a streamlined, one-page checkout process.
Delivery options: Allow customers to choose between delivery time slots or in-store pickup.
Order tracking: Provide real-time order status and delivery updates.
Ratings and reviews: Allow customers to rate and review products. 
For the admin and staff
Order management: Track order statuses, update fulfillment details, and manage cancellations and returns.
Inventory control: Manage stock levels, add new products, and track perishable items by expiration date.
Real-time reporting: Generate sales reports, analyze customer behavior, and get insights on operational efficiency.
Multi-store management: A centralized dashboard to control inventory, sales, and customer data across multiple locations.
Promotions and offers: Manage coupons, discounts, and membership programs.
